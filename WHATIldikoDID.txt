Within CONFIG.PY:
###	If you’re using Flask-Bcrypt to hash user passwords,
###	you’ll need to specify the number of “rounds” that the algorithm
###	executes in hashing a password. The more rounds used to hash a password,
###	the longer it’ll take for an attacker to guess a password given the
###	hash. The number of rounds should increase over time as computing powe
###	r increases.



Within VIEWS.PY:

# This page is to set views of the future site 
# define all routes and their functions
